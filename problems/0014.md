# [Problem 14: Longest Common Prefix](https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-common-prefix/)

## Solution

```py
# Time complexity: O(n * m)
# Space complexity: O(1)
class Solution:
    def longestCommonPrefix(self, strs: List[str]) -> str:
        res = ""

        for i in range(0, len(strs[0])):
            for s in strs:
                if i == len(s) or strs[0][i] != s[i]:
                    return res

            res += strs[0][i]

        return res
```

## Notes

We use the first element as a reference and compare each character of it with the corresponding character of the other strings. If we find a mismatch, we return the result. Otherwise, we add the character to the result.

## Questions to interviewer

1. Can we assume that the input list is not empty?
