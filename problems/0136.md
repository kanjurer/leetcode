# [Problem 136: Single Number](https://leetcode.com/problems/single-number/)

## Solution

```py
class Solution:
    def singleNumber(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        res = 0
        for n in nums:
            res = n ^ res
        return res
```

## Notes

Use XOR to find the single number.
Concept: XOR of a number with itself is 0, and XOR of a number with 0 is the number itself.
Therefore, XOR of all numbers will cancel out the duplicates and leave the single number.

## Questions to interviewer
