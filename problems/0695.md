# [Problem 695: Max Area of Island](https://leetcode.com/problems/max-area-of-island/)

## Solution

```py
# Time complexity: O(m*n)
# Space complexity: O(m*n)
class Solution:
    def maxAreaOfIsland(self, grid: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        if not grid:
            return 0

        islands = 0

        m = len(grid)
        n = len(grid[0])

        visited = set()

        def bfs(i, j):
            q = deque([(i, j)])
            visited.add((i, j))
            area = 1

            while q:
                nr, nc = q.popleft()
                directions = [(0, 1), (0, -1), (1, 0), (-1, 0)]

                for dr, dc in directions:
                    r = nr + dr
                    c = nc + dc
                    if (
                        r in range(m)
                        and c in range(n)
                        and grid[r][c] == 1
                        and (r, c) not in visited
                    ):
                        area += 1
                        visited.add((r, c))
                        q.append((r, c))

            return area

        max_area = 0

        for i in range(m):
            for j in range(n):
                if grid[i][j] == 1 and ((i, j) not in visited):
                    max_area = max(max_area, bfs(i, j))

        return max_area
