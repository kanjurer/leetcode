# [Problem 169: Majority Element](https://leetcode.com/problems/majority-element/)

## Solution

```py
# Time Complexity: O(n)
# Space Complexity: O(n)
class Solution:
    def majorityElement(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        count = {}
        res, max_count = 0, 0
        for num in nums:
            count[num] = count.get(num, 0) + 1
            res = num if count[num] > max_count else res
            max_count = max(max_count, count[num])

        return res

# Boyer-Moore Voting Algorithm

# Time Complexity: O(n)
# Space Complexity: O(1)
class Solution:
    def majorityElement(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        count = 0
        candidate = None

        for num in nums:
            if count == 0:
                candidate = num
            count += 1 if num == candidate else -1

        return candidate
```

## Notes

Easy solution is using hashmap.
Harder solution is using Boyer-Moore Voting Algorithm.

**Boyer-Moore Voting Algorithm:**
This algorithm does NOT tell you if there is a majority element in the array. It only tells you the majority element if it exists.
A second pass is needed to verify if the candidate is the majority element.

## Questions to interviewer

1. Is it guaranteed that the majority element always exists?
