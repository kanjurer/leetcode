# [Problem 141: Linked List Cycle](https://leetcode.com/problems/linked-list-cycle/)

## Solution

```py
# Time complexity: O(n)
# Space complexity: O(1)
class Solution:
    def hasCycle(self, head: Optional[ListNode]) -> bool:
        slow = fast = head

        while fast and fast.next:
            slow = slow.next
            fast = fast.next.next

            if slow == fast: return True

        return False
```

## Notes

**Floyd's Tortoise and Hare**

In this algorithm, we have two pointers, a slow pointer and a fast pointer. The slow pointer moves one step at a time, while the fast pointer moves two steps at a time. If there is a cycle in the linked list, the fast pointer will eventually catch up to the slow pointer. If there is no cycle, the fast pointer will reach the end of the linked list.

Proof: Say the gap between the slow and fast pointers is `k`. The slow pointer moves by 1, but fast pointer moves by 2. So the gap between them decreases by 1 at each step. So the gap will be closed in `k` steps.
