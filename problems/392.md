## Solution

```py
# Time complexity: O(n)
# Space complexity: O(1)
class Solution:
    def isSubsequence(self, s: str, t: str) -> bool:
        m = len(s)
        n = len(t)
        i, j = 0, 0

        while i < m and j < n:
            if s[i] == t[j]:
                i += 1
            j += 1

        return i == m
