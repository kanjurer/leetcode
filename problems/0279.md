# [Problem 279: Perfect Squares](https://leetcode.com/problems/perfect-squares/)

## Solution

```py
# Bottom Up DP
# Time complexity: O(n*sqrt(n))
# Space complexity: O(n)
class Solution:
    def numSquares(self, n: int) -> int:
        dp = [float("inf")] * (n + 1)

        sq_nums = [i * i for i in range(int(sqrt(n)) + 1)]
        dp[0] = 0

        for i in range(1, n + 1):
            for sq in sq_nums:
                if i - sq < 0: break
                dp[i] = min(dp[i], dp[i - sq] + 1)

        return dp[n]

# Math
# Time complexity: O(sqrt(n))
# Space complexity: O(1)
class Solution:
    def numSquares(self, n: int) -> int:
        def isSq(n):
            sq = int(sqrt(n))
            return sq*sq == n

        while n % 4 == 0:
            n = n // 4

        if n % 8 == 7:
            return 4

        if isSq(n):
            return 1

        for i in range(1, int(sqrt(n)) + 1):
            if isSq(n - i*i):
                return 2

        return 3
```

## Notes

This is SAME as coin change problem.

Math Solution:

- Any number can be written as sum of 4 squares.
- If a number is not of the for 4^k(8m+7), then it can be written as sum of 1, 2 or 3 squares.
- If a number is a perfect square, then it can be written as sum of 1 square.
- If a number can be written as n^2 + m^2, then it can be written as sum of 2 squares.
- Otherwise, it can be written as sum of 3 squares.
