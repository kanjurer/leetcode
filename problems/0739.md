# [Problem 739: Daily Temperatures](https://leetcode.com/problems/daily-temperatures/)

## Solution

```py
# Monotonic stack
# Time complexity: O(n)
# Space complexity: O(n)
class Solution:
    def dailyTemperatures(self, temperatures: List[int]) -> List[int]:
        ans = [0] * len(temperatures)
        s = []

        for i, t in enumerate(temperatures):
            while s:
                j, tx = s[-1]
                if t > tx:
                    ans[j] = i - j
                    s.pop()
                else:
                    break

            s.append((i, t))

        return ans
```

## Notes

The idea here is to maintain a stack that is monotonic (decreasing values). As soon as we find a value that is greater than the incoming value, we can calculate the difference in indices and update the answer, and pop the value. We keep doing this until we find a value that is greater than the incoming value.
