# [Problem 3195: Find the Minimum Area to Cover All Ones I](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-the-minimum-area-to-cover-all-ones-i/)

## Solution

```py
# Greedy
# Time complexity: O(m*n)
# Space complexity: O(1)
class Solution:
    def minimumArea(self, grid: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        m = len(grid)
        n = len(grid[0])


        u = m - 1
        d = 0
        l = n - 1
        r = 0

        for i in range(m):
            for j in range(n):
                if grid[i][j] == 1:
                    u = min(u, i)
                    d = max(d, i)
                    l = min(l, j)
                    r = max(r, j)

        return (d - u + 1) * (r - l + 1)
```

## Notes

We need to find the up, down, left, and right boundaries of the rectangle.
