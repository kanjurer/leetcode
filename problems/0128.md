## Solution

```py
# Time complexity: O(nlogn)
# Space complexity: O(1)
class Solution:
    def longestConsecutive(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        if not nums:
            return 0
        nums.sort()
        max_len = 1
        cur_len = 1
        for i in range(1, len(nums)):
            if nums[i] != nums[i-1]:
                if nums[i] == nums[i-1] + 1:
                    cur_len += 1
                else:
                    max_len = max(max_len, cur_len)
                    cur_len = 1
        return max(max_len, cur_len)

# Time complexity: O(n)
# Space complexity: O(n)
class Solution:
    def longestConsecutive(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        if not nums:
            return 0

        m = {}
        for num in set(nums):
            m[num] = False

        max_len = 0

        for num in nums:
            curr_len = 1

            # backwards
            tmp = num - 1
            while tmp in m and not m[tmp]:
                curr_len += 1
                m[tmp] = True
                tmp -= 1

            # forwards
            tmp = num + 1
            while tmp in m and not m[tmp]:
                curr_len += 1
                m[tmp] = True
                tmp += 1

            max_len = max(max_len, curr_len)

        return max_len

# Time complexity: O(n)
# Space complexity: O(n)
class Solution:
    def longestConsecutive(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        num_set = set(nums)
        max_length = 0

        for num in num_set:
            if num - 1 not in num_set:
                length = 0
                while num + length in num_set:
                    length += 1

                max_length = max(max_length, length)

        return max_length

```

## Notes

Solution 1: Sort the array and iterate through it to find the longest consecutive sequence. Time complexity is O(nlogn) and space complexity is O(1).
Solution 2: Use a hash map to store the numbers and their status. Iterate through the array and find the longest consecutive sequence. Time complexity is O(n) and space complexity is O(n).
Solution 3: Use a hash set to store the numbers. Find the numbers that are starting points of the consecutive sequence and find the longest consecutive sequence. Time complexity is O(n) and space complexity is O(n).

## Questions to interviewer

1. Can I use extra space?
2. Can there be duplicates in the array?
