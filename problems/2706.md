# [Problem 2706: Buy Two Chocolates](https://leetcode.com/problems/buy-two-chocolates/)

## Solution

```py
# Time complexity: O(n)
# Space complexity: O(1)
class Solution:
    def buyChoco(self, prices: List[int], money: int) -> int:
        min_1 = float("inf")
        min_2 = float("inf")

        for price in prices:
            if price < min_1:
                min_2 = min_1
                min_1 = price
            elif price < min_2:
                min_2 = price

        if min_1 + min_2 > money:
            return money
        else:
            return money - (min_1 + min_2)
```

## Notes

**Greedy Approach**: We want to be greedy and find the two smallest elements in the array, which can be done in O(n) time.
