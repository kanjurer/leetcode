# [Problem 435: Non-overlapping Intervals](https://leetcode.com/problems/non-overlapping-intervals/)

## Solution

```py
# Greedy
# Time complexity: O(nlogn)
# Space complexity: O(1)
class Solution:
    def eraseOverlapIntervals(self, intervals: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        intervals.sort()

        ans = 0

        prev_end = float('-inf')

        for x, y in intervals:
            if x < prev_end:
                ans += 1
                prev_end = min(y, prev_end)
            else:
                prev_end = y

        return ans
```

## Notes

After we sort the list, we want to keep the intervals on the far left, because they will have the smallest end time which would minimize the overlap.
