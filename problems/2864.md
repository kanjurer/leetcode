# [Problem 2864: Maximum Odd Binary Number](https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-odd-binary-number/)

## Solution

```py
# Time complexity: O(n)
# Space complexity: O(1)
class Solution:
    def maximumOddBinaryNumber(self, s: str) -> str:
        n = len(s)
        ones = -1
        for c in s:
            if c == "1":
                ones += 1

        return "1" * ones + "0" * (n - ones - 1) + "1"

# Quick Sort
# Time complexity: O(n)
# Space complexity: O(1)
class Solution:
    def maximumOddBinaryNumber(self, s: str) -> str:
        n = len(s)
        arr = [c for c in s]

        l = 0
        for r in range(n):
            if arr[r] == "1":
                arr[l], arr[r] = arr[r], arr[l]
                l += 1

        arr[l - 1], arr[n - 1] = arr[n - 1], arr[l - 1]

        return "".join(arr)
```

## Notes

Greedy: Move all ones to the left except one 1 to the right.

Solution 1: Count 1s and construct the result.

Solution 2: Quick Sort: move zeroes to the right and for the edge case, move the last 1 to the right.

## Questions to interviewer

1. Can I use extra space for quick sort?
