# [Problem 167: Two Sum II - Input array is sorted](https://leetcode.com/problems/two-sum-ii-input-array-is-sorted/)

## Solution

```py
# Time complexity: O(n)
# Space complexity: O(1)
class Solution:
    def twoSum(self, numbers: List[int], target: int) -> List[int]:
        l = 0
        r = len(numbers) - 1

        while l < r:
            if numbers[l] + numbers[r] < target:
                l += 1
            elif numbers[l] + numbers[r] > target:
                r -= 1
            else:
                return [l + 1, r + 1]

        return None
```

## Notes

Two pointer solution.

Why does it work?

**Proof:**
Suppose exists a sorted array of n such that exists 2 indexes a,b that give the required sum
Without loss of generality, `a < b`, but somehow after running the algorithm we do not get any solution.
Now consider that at each step we only move the upper pointer down 1 index, or lower pointer up 1 index.
Which means at some point before the alogrithm terminates, one of the pointers must be at a or b. Since we only moved the pointer by 1 each time it is either the lower pointer at a or upper pointer at b.
If the lower pointer at a, then the upper pointer must be larger than b since it is the first time either pointer hits {a,b}.
Then sorted array implies that the current sum must be larger than required sum, so we will keep moving the upper pointer down by 1 until it eventually hits b.
Vice versa if upper pointer at b.

## Questions to interviewer

1. Can we assume that the array is sorted?
