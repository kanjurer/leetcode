# [Problem 160: Intersection of Two Linked Lists](https://leetcode.com/problems/intersection-of-two-linked-lists/)

## Solution

```py
# Trick with two pointers
# Time complexity: O(n)
# Space complexity: O(1)
class Solution:
    def getIntersectionNode(self, headA: ListNode, headB: ListNode) -> Optional[ListNode]:
        l1 = headA
        l2 = headB

        while l1 != l2: # There will be a point where they will meet
            l1 = l1.next if l1 else headB
            l2 = l2.next if l2 else headA

        return l1

# Length of the linked lists
# Time complexity: O(n)
# Space complexity: O(1)
class Solution:
    def getIntersectionNode(self, headA: ListNode, headB: ListNode) -> Optional[ListNode]:
        l1 = headA
        len1 = 0
        while l1:
            len1 += 1
            l1 = l1.next

        l2 = headB
        len2 = 0
        while l2:
            len2 += 1
            l2 = l2.next

        if len1 > len2:
            len1, len2 = len2, len1
            headA, headB = headB, headA

        for _ in range(len2 - len1):
            headB = headB.next

        while headA and headB and headA != headB:
            headA = headA.next
            headB = headB.next

        return headA


# Time complexity: O(n)
# Space complexity: O(n)
class Solution:
    def getIntersectionNode(self, headA: ListNode, headB: ListNode) -> Optional[ListNode]:
        visited = set()

        while headA or headB:
            if headA:
                if headA in visited: return headA
                visited.add(headA)
                headA = headA.next

            if headB:
                if headB in visited: return headB
                visited.add(headB)
                headB = headB.next

        return None
```

## Notes

Approach 1:

len(l1) = x + z
len(l2) = y + z

Once we find length of l1 and l2, we can find the difference between the lengths of l1 and l2. We can move the pointer of the longer list by the difference. Then we can move both pointers until they meet.

Approach 2:

Use extra space to store the visited nodes.

Approach 3:

Two poiners.

## Questions to interviewer

1. Can we use extra space?
