# [Problem 547: Number of Provinces](https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-provinces)

## Solution

```py
# Time complexity: O(n^2)
# Space complexity: O(n)
class Solution:
    def findCircleNum(self, isConnected: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        ans = 0
        n = len(isConnected)

        visited = set()
        def dfs(n):
            if n in visited:
                return

            visited.add(n)

            for i in range(len(isConnected)):
                if isConnected[i][n]:
                    dfs(i)

        for i in range(n):
            if i not in visited:
                dfs(i)
                ans += 1

        return ans
```

## Notes

This is same as finding number of connected components in a graph. We can use DFS or BFS to solve this problem.
