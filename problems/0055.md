# [Problem 55: Jump Game](https://leetcode.com/problems/jump-game/)

## Solution

```py
# Greedy
# Time complexity: O(n)
# Space complexity: O(1)
class Solution:
    def canJump(self, nums: List[int]) -> bool:
        n = len(nums)

        goal = n - 1
        for i in range(n - 2, -1, -1):
            if i + nums[i] >= goal:
                goal = i

        return goal == 0
```

## Notes

We start from backwards, and continue to move `goal` to the left. We stop if `goal = 0`.

## Questions to interviewer

1. What if the input is empty?
