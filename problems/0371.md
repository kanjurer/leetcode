# [Problem 371: Sum of Two Integers](https://leetcode.com/problems/sum-of-two-integers/)

## Solution

```c
// Recursive
int getSum(int a, int b) {
    if(b == 0) return a;

    return getSum(a ^ b, (unsigned)(a & b) << 1);
}

// Iterative
int getSum(int a, int b) {
    while(b != 0){
        int tmp = a ^ b;
        b = (unsigned)(a & b) << 1;
        a = tmp;
    }

    return a;
}
```

## Notes

We use the following logic:

- When we XOR two numbers, it adds them without carrying.
- When we AND two numbers, it gives us the carry.

So

```
a + b = (a ^ b) + (a & b) << 1

The idea is that, we repeat this recursively until b becomes 0, so we don't end up using `+` operation
```

## Questions to interviewer

1. Recursive or iterative?
2. Can we use bitwise operators?
