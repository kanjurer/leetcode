# [Problem 230: Kth Smallest Element in a BST](https://leetcode.com/problems/kth-smallest-element-in-a-bst/)

## Solution

```py
# Time complexity: O(n)
# Space complexity: O(n)
class Solution:
    def kthSmallest(self, root: Optional[TreeNode], k: int) -> int:
        # inorder search
        ans = []

        s = [(root, False)]

        while s:
            curr, visited = s.pop()

            if visited:
                ans.append(curr.val)
            else:
                if curr:
                    if curr.right: s.append((curr.right, False))
                    s.append((curr, True))
                    if curr.left: s.append((curr.left, False))

        return ans[k - 1]
```

## Notes

Since Binary Search Tree is sorted already, inorder traversal will give us the sorted order of the elements. We can then return the kth element from the list.

Follow up: What if the BST is modified (insert/delete operations) often and you need to find the kth smallest frequently? How would you optimize the kthSmallest routine?

Answer:
For each node, we can store the number of nodes in the left subtree. This way, we can find the kth smallest element in O(log n) time.
