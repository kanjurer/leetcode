# [Problem 2848: Points That Intersect With Cars](https://leetcode.com/problems/points-that-intersect-with-cars/)

## Solution

```py
# Time complexity: O(nlogn)
# Space complexity: O(n)
class Solution:
    def numberOfPoints(self, nums: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        nums.sort()

        output = [nums[0]]

        for s, e in nums[1:]:
            last_end = output[-1][1]

            if s <= last_end:
                output[-1][1] = max(last_end, e)
            else:
                output.append([s, e])

        return sum([e - s + 1 for s, e in output])
```
