# [Problem 875: Koko Eating Bananas](https://leetcode.com/problems/koko-eating-bananas/)

## Solution

```py
# Time complexity: O(log(max(piles)) * n)
# Space complexity: O(1)
class Solution:
    def minEatingSpeed(self, piles: List[int], h: int) -> int:
        l, r = 1, max(piles)
        ans = 0

        while l <= r:
            k = l + (r - l) // 2
            hrs = 0

            for p in piles:
                hrs += p // k + (p % k != 0)

            if hrs > h:
                l = k + 1
            else:
                ans = k # tricky part, try to understand why we update ans here
                r = k - 1

        return ans

# Time complexity: O(max(piles) * n)
# Space complexity: O(1)
class Solution:
    def minEatingSpeed(self, piles: List[int], h: int) -> int:
        for k in range(1, max(piles) + 1):
            hrs = 0

            for p in piles:
                hrs += p // k + (p % k != 0)

            if hrs == h:
                return k

        return -1
```

## Notes

The main idea is to run through numbers from `[1, max(piles)]`. We optimize search for `k` by using binary search.

In the binary search solution, it is a bit tricky to figure out when to update `l` and `r` and also `ans`.

## Questions to interviewer

1. I will code up the linear search solution first, then the binary search solution. Is that okay?
