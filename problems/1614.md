# [Problem 1614: Maximum Nesting Depth of the Parentheses](https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-nesting-depth-of-the-parentheses/)

## Solution

```py
# Time complexity: O(n)
# Space complexity: O(1)
class Solution:
    def maxDepth(self, s: str) -> int:
        ans = 0
        count = 0

        for c in s:
            if c == '(':
                count += 1
            elif c == ')':
                count -= 1

            ans = max(ans, count)

        return ans


```

## Notes

In general, we need to use stack but since the paranthesis are always `()`, we can use one variable

## Questions to interviewer

1. What kind of paranthesis can I expect: `) } ] `?
