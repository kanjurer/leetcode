class Solution:
    def lengthOfLIS(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        n = len(nums)

        dp = [1] * n

        for i in range(n - 1, -1, -1):
            for j in range(i + 1, n):
                if nums[i] < nums[j]:
                    dp[i] = max(dp[i], 1 + dp[j])

        return max(dp)
```

## Notes

Approach 1:

- We can solve this problem using dynamic programming.
- Here we have a recursive relation: `LIS[i] = max(1 + LIS[i + 1], 1 + LIS[i + 2], ..., 1 + LIS[n - 1])` if `nums[i] < nums[i + 1]` where `LIS[i]` is the length of the longest increasing subsequence starting at index `i`.
