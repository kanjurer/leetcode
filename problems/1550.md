# [Problem 1550: Three Consecutive Odds](https://leetcode.com/problems/three-consecutive-odds/)

## Solution

```py
# More optimized
# Time complexity: O(n)
# Space complexity: O(1)
class Solution:
    def threeConsecutiveOdds(self, arr: List[int]) -> bool:
        count = 0

        for num in arr:
            if num % 2 == 1:
                count += 1
            else:
                count = 0 # reset count

            if count == 3: return True

        return False


# Time complexity: O(n)
# Space complexity: O(1)
class Solution:
    def threeConsecutiveOdds(self, arr: List[int]) -> bool:
        n = len(arr)

        for i in range(2, n):
            if arr[i] % 2 == 1 and arr[i - 1] % 2 == 1 and arr[i - 2] % 2 == 1:
                return True

        return False
```

## Notes

Approach 1: Keep window size 3

Approach 2: Keep count variable and reset it when even number is found, otherwise increment it till 3

## Questions to interviewer

1. What if size of the array is less than 3?
