# [Problem 286: Walls and Gates](https://leetcode.com/problems/walls-and-gates/)

## Solution

```py
# Time complexity: O(mn)
# Space complexity: O(1)
class Solution:
    def wallsAndGates(self, rooms: List[List[int]]) -> None:
        """
        Do not return anything, modify rooms in-place instead.
        """

        m = len(rooms)
        n = len(rooms[0])

        INF = 2147483647
        dirs = [(0, -1), (0, 1), (1, 0), (-1, 0)]

        q = deque()

        for i in range(m):
            for j in range(n):
                if rooms[i][j] == 0:
                    q.append((i, j))

        while q:
            for _ in range(len(q)):
                r, c = q.popleft()

                for dr, dc in dirs:
                    nr, nc = r + dr, c + dc

                    if nr in range(m) and nc in range(n):
                        if rooms[nr][nc] != -1 and rooms[nr][nc] > rooms[r][c] + 1:
                            rooms[nr][nc] = rooms[r][c] + 1
                            q.append((nr, nc))
```

## Notes

We do a simultaneous BFS similar to [Problem 994: Rotting Oranges](https://leetcode.com/problems/rotting-oranges/).
