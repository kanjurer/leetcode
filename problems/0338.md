# [Problem 338: Counting Bits](https://leetcode.com/problems/counting-bits/)

## Solution

```py
# Time complexity: O(n)
# Space complexity: O(n)
class Solution:
    def countBits(self, n: int) -> List[int]:
        dp = [0] * (n + 1)
        power = 1
        for i in range(1, n + 1):
            if power * 2 == i:
                power = i
            dp[i] = 1 + dp[i - power]

        return dp

# Time complexity: O(nlogn)
# Space complexity: O(n)
class Solution:
    def countBits(self, n: int) -> List[int]:
        dp = [0] * (n + 1)

        # O(n)
        for i in range(1, n + 1):
            power = int(log(i, 2)) # O(1) since 32-bit but in general, it is O(log(bits))
            offset = i - 2**power
            dp[i] = 1 + dp[offset]

        return dp
```

## Notes

Here, we keep track of the power of two and then use DP to calculate the number of bits.

```
if num = 2**k + offset
then dp[num] = 1 + dp[offset]
```
