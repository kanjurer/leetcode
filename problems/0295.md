# [Problem 295: Find Median from Data Stream](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-median-from-data-stream/)

## Solution

```py
class MedianFinder:
    def __init__(self):
        self.max_heap = []
        self.min_heap = []

    # Time complexity: O(nlogn)
    # Space complexity: O(n)
    def addNum(self, num: int) -> None:
        # appending elements
        if self.max_heap and num > -1 * self.max_heap[0]:
            heappush(self.min_heap, num)
        else:
            heappush(self.max_heap, -1 * num)

        n1 = len(self.max_heap)
        n2 = len(self.min_heap)

        # balancing act
        if n1 - n2 > 1:
            el = -1 * heappop(self.max_heap)
            heappush(self.min_heap, el)
        elif n2 - n1 > 1:
            el = heappop(self.min_heap)
            heappush(self.max_heap, -1 * el)

    # Time complexity: O(1)
    # Space complexity: O(1)
    def findMedian(self) -> float:
        n1 = len(self.max_heap)
        n2 = len(self.min_heap)

        if n1 > n2:
            return -1 * self.max_heap[0]

        if n1 < n2:
            return self.min_heap[0]

        return (-1 * self.max_heap[0] + self.min_heap[0]) / 2
```

## Notes

Here, instead of sorting the array on `findMedian` call, we keep the array sorted when `add` is called. But sorting in itself is not worth it. We instead, keep 2 sorted heaps, half and half. The first one is max heap and other one is min heap so getting the 2 middle elements is a O(1) operation.
