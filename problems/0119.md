# [Problem 119: Pascal's Triangle II](https://leetcode.com/problems/pascals-triangle-ii/)

## Solution

```py
# Time complexity: O(numRows^2)
# Space complexity: O(1) extra space
class Solution:
    def getRow(self, rowIndex: int) -> List[int]:
        dp = [1] * (rowIndex + 1)
        dp[0] = 1

        for i in range(1, rowIndex):
            for j in range(i, 0, -1):
                dp[j] += dp[j - 1]

        return dp

# Time complexity: O(numRows^2)
# Space complexity: O(1) extra space
class Solution:
    def getRow(self, rowIndex: int) -> List[int]:
        dp = [0] * (rowIndex + 1)
        dp[0] = 1

        for i in range(1, rowIndex + 1):
            prev = dp[0]
            for j in range(1, i + 1):
                tmp = dp[j]
                dp[j] = dp[j] + prev
                prev = tmp

        return dp
```

## Notes

- [Problem 118: Pascal's Triangle](https://leetcode.com/problems/pascals-triangle/)
- [Problem 119: Pascal's Triangle II](https://leetcode.com/problems/pascals-triangle-ii/)

Naive solution is to generate the entire Pascal's triangle and return the last row. This solution has a time complexity of O(numRows^2) and space complexity of O(numRows^2).
