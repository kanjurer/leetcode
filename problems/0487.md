# [Problem 487: Max Consecutive Ones II](https://leetcode.com/problems/max-consecutive-ones-ii/)

## Solution

```py
# Time complexity: O(n)
# Space complexity: O(1)
class Solution:
    def findMaxConsecutiveOnes(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        n = len(nums)

        l = 0
        count = 0
        ans = 0
        k = 1 # k = 1 for this problem

        for r in range(n):
            if nums[r] == 0: count += 1
            while count > k:
                if nums[l] == 0: count -= 1
                l += 1
            ans = max(r - l + 1, ans)

        return ans

# Follow-up: What if the input numbers come in one by one as an infinite stream?
# Time complexity: O(n)
# Space complexity: O(n)
class Solution:
    def findMaxConsecutiveOnes(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        n = len(nums)

        l = 0
        k = 1
        ans = 0
        q = deque()

        for r in range(n):
            if nums[r] == 0:
                q.append(r)
            if len(q) > k:
                l = q.popleft() + 1
            ans = max(ans, r - l + 1) # max-check every for iteration

        return ans
```

**Follow up:** What if the input numbers come in one by one as an infinite stream? In other words, you can't store all numbers coming from the stream as it's too large to hold in memory. Could you solve it efficiently?

In follow-up scenarios where direct access to prior elements via nums[left] may not suffice or be efficient, an alternative approach is advocated:

**Zeroes Position Queue:** Maintain a queue to record the positions of encountered zeroes. This queue becomes instrumental in precisely determining the next position to which the left boundary should shift when the window needs to exclude a zero to adhere to the k flips constraint.

## Questions to interviewer

1. Is the array guaranteed to contain only 0s and 1s?
