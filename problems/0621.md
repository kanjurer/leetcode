# [Problem 621: Task Scheduler](https://leetcode.com/problems/task-scheduler/)

## Solution

```py
# Greedy
# Time complexity: O(n) [n = len(tasks)]
# Space complexity: O(1)


# Heap
# Time complexity: O(nlogk) [= O(n) n = len(tasks) k = 26]
# Space complexity: O(k) [k = 26]
class Solution:
    def leastInterval(self, tasks: List[str], n: int) -> int:
        heap = [-v for v in Counter(tasks).values()]
        heapify(heap) # O(n)

        time = 0
        q = deque()

        while heap or q:
            time += 1
            if heap:
                v = -heappop(heap)
                v -= 1
                if v > 0:
                    q.append((v, time + n))
            else:
                time = q[0][1]

            if q and q[0][1] == time:
                heappush(heap, -q.popleft()[0])

        return time
