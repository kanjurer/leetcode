# [Problem 392: Is Subsequence](https://leetcode.com/problems/is-subsequence/)

## Solution

```py
class Solution:
    def isSubsequence(self, s: str, t: str) -> bool:
        m = len(s)
        n = len(t)
        i, j = 0, 0

        while i < m and j < n:
            if s[i] == t[j]:
                i += 1
            j += 1

        return i == m
```

## Notes

Use two pointer approach. Key thing is to check if s is empty string.

## Questions to interviewer

1. What should I do if length of t is less than length of s?
