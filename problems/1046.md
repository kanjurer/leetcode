# [Problem 1046: Last Stone Weight](https://leetcode.com/problems/last-stone-weight/)

## Solution

```py
# Time complexity: O(nlogn)
# Space complexity: O(n)
class Solution:
    def lastStoneWeight(self, stones: List[int]) -> int:
        n = len(stones)

        for i in range(n):
            stones[i] = -stones[i]

        heapify(stones)

        while len(stones) > 1:
            x = -heappop(stones)
            y = -heappop(stones)
            if x != y:
                heappush(stones, -abs(x - y))

        return -stones[0] if stones else 0
```

## Notes

Use a heap to keep track of the stones. Pop the two heaviest stones, smash them together, and push the result back into the heap. Repeat until there is only one or no stone left.
