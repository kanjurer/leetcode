# [Problem 1299: Replace Elements with Greatest Element on Right Side](https://leetcode.com/problems/replace-elements-with-greatest-element-on-right-side/)

## Solution

```py
# Time complexity: O(n)
# Space complexity: O(1)
class Solution:
    def replaceElements(self, arr: List[int]) -> List[int]:
        n = len(arr)
        max_right = -1
        for i in range(n - 1, -1, -1):
            arr[i], max_right = max_right, max(max_right, arr[i])
        return arr
```

## Notes

A naive approach would be to iterate the array from left to right and for each element, find the maximum element on the right side. This would take O(n^2) time complexity. We can optimize this by iterating the array from right to left and keeping track of the maximum element on the right side of the current element. We can update the current element with the maximum element on the right side.

We do not need a 'prefix' array to store the maximum element on the right side. We can use a variable to store the maximum element on the right side and update it as we iterate the array from right to left.

We are iterating the array from right to left and keeping track of the maximum element on the right side of the current element. We are updating the current element with the maximum element on the right side.

## Questions to interviewer

1. Do I need to return a new array or modify it in place?
