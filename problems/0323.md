# [Problem 323: Number of Connected Components in an Undirected Graph](https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-connected-components-in-an-undirected-graph/)

## Solution

```py
# Time complexity: O(E + V)
# Space complexity: O(V)
class Solution:
    def countComponents(self, n: int, edges: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        adj = defaultdict(list)

        for n1, n2 in edges:
            adj[n1].append(n2)
            adj[n2].append(n1)

        visited = set()

        def bfs(n):
            q = deque([n])

            while q:
                n = q.popleft()
                visited.add(n)
                for c in adj[n]:
                    if c in visited: continue
                    q.append(c)

        ans = 0

        for i in range(n):
            if i in visited: continue
            bfs(i)
            ans += 1

        return ans
