# [Problem 191: Number of 1 Bits](https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-1-bits/)

## Solution

```py
# Time complexity: O(m), where m is the number of "1" bits in n
# Space complexity: O(1)
class Solution:
    def hammingWeight(self, n: int) -> int:
        count = 0
        while n:
            n &= (n-1)
            count += 1
        return count

# Time complexity: O(m), where m is the number of all bits in n
# Space complexity: O(1)
class Solution:
    def hammingWeight(self, n: int) -> int:
        count = 0
        while n:
            count += n % 2
            n = n >> 1
        return count
```

## Notes

Hamming weight is the number of "1" bits in a number.
The trick is to keep &ing the number with `n-1` until it becomes 0. This operation will count the number of "1" bits in the number.

The reason this works is because `n-1` will flip the rightmost "1" bit and all the bits to the right of it. When we & the number with `n-1`, the rightmost "1" bit will be removed.
Mathematically:

```math
n = x1y
n - 1 = x0y'
```

Example:

```math
n = 110100
n-1 = 110011
n & (n-1) = 110000 # removes the rightmost "1" bit

n = 110000
n-1 = 101111
n & (n-1) = 100000 # removes the rightmost "1" bit

n = 100000
n-1 = 011111
n & (n-1) = 000000 # removes the rightmost "1" bit
```

## Questions to interviewer

1. What is the range of the input number?
2. Can the input number be negative?
