# [Problem 191: Number of 1 Bits](https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-1-bits/)

## Solution

```py
# Time complexity: O(m), where m is the number of "1" bits in n
# Space complexity: O(1)
class Solution:
    def hammingWeight(self, n: int) -> int:
        count = 0
        while n:
            count += n & 1
            n >>= 1
        return count

# Time complexity: O(m), where m is the number of all bits in n
# Space complexity: O(1)
class Solution:
    def hammingWeight(self, n: int) -> int:
        count = 0
        while n:
            count += n % 2
            n = n >> 1
        return count
```
