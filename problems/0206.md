# [Problem 206: Reverse Linked List](https://leetcode.com/problems/reverse-linked-list/)

## Solution

```py
# Time complexity: O(n)
# Space complexity: O(1)
class Solution:
    def reverseList(self, head: Optional[ListNode]) -> Optional[ListNode]:
        prev = None
        curr = head

        while curr:
            tmp = curr.next
            curr.next = prev
            prev = curr
            curr = tmp

        return prev

# Time complexity: O(n)
# Space complexity: O(n)
class Solution:
    def reverseList(self, head: Optional[ListNode]) -> Optional[ListNode]:
        if not head:
            return None

        if not head.next:
            return head

        reversed_list = self.reverseList(head.next)

        head.next.next = head
        head.next = None

        return reversed_list
```

## Notes

Iterative solution: keep track of prev node and next node.
Rercursive solution: Simple

## Questions to interviewer

1. Should I write iterative or recursive solution?
