# [Problem 70: Climbing Stairs](https://leetcode.com/problems/climbing-stairs/)

## Solution

```py
# Time complexity: O(n)
# Space complexity: O(1)
class Solution:
    def climbStairs(self, n: int) -> int:
        if n <= 3:
            return n

        first = 2
        second = 3

        for i in range(4, n + 1):
            tmp = first + second
            first = second
            second = tmp

        return second
```

## Notes

This is similar to fibonacci sequence.
Think of recursive solution first: `f(n) = f(n-1) + f(n-2)`.
Then think of memoization.
Then think of iterative solution.

Why `n + 1` in the loop? Because we want to execute the loop `n` times in total, and we are starting from `4`. So we need to loop `n - 3` times.
