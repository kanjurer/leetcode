## Solution

```py
# Time complexity: O(m + n)
# Space complexity: O(1)
class Solution:
    def mergeAlternately(self, word1: str, word2: str) -> str:
        m = len(word1)
        n = len(word2)

        ans = ""
        for i in range(min(m, n)):
            ans += word1[i] + word2[i]

        if m < n:
            ans += word2[m:n]
        elif m > n:
            ans += word1[n:m]

        return ans
