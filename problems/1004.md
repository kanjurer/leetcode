# [Problem 1004: Max Consecutive Ones III](https://leetcode.com/problems/max-consecutive-ones-iii/)

## Solution

```py
# Time complexity: O(n)
# Space complexity: O(1)
class Solution:
    def longestOnes(self, nums: List[int], k: int) -> int:
        n = len(nums)

        l = 0
        count = 0
        ans = 0

        for r in range(n):
            if nums[r] == 0: count += 1
            while count > k:
                if nums[l] == 0: count -= 1
                l += 1
            ans = max(r - l + 1, ans)

        return ans

```
