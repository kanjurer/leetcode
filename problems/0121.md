# [Problem 121: Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock](https://leetcode.com/problems/best-time-to-buy-and-sell-stock/)

## Solution

```py
# Time complexity: O(n)
# Space complexity: O(1)
class Solution:
    def maxProfit(self, prices: List[int]) -> int:
        n = len(prices)

        if n == 0:
            return 0

        l, r = 0, 1
        max_profit = 0

        while r < n:
            if prices[l] < prices[r]:
                max_profit = max(max_profit, prices[r] - prices[l])
            else:
                l = r

            r += 1

        return max_profit
```

## Notes

**Dynamic Sliding Window approach**
We keep a window, starting with size 1:

- if `prices[l] <  prices[r]`, we just move the right pointer
- if `prices[l] >= prices[r]`, we move the left pointer to the right pointer. We do NOT do `l += 1` because we keep moving r and we have covered the cases from `[l, r-1]` already.

## Questions to interviewer

1. Can I assume that the prices are always positive?
