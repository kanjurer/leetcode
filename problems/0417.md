# [Problem 417: Pacific Atlantic Water Flow](https://leetcode.com/problems/pacific-atlantic-water-flow/)

## Solution

```py
# Time complexity: O(n)
# Space complexity: O(n)
class Solution:
    def pacificAtlantic(self, heights: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
        m = len(heights)
        n = len(heights[0])

        pac = set()
        atl = set()

        DIRS = [(1, 0), (-1, 0), (0, 1), (0, -1)]
        def dfs(i, j, visited):
            visited.add((i, j))
            for dr, dc in DIRS:
                r = i + dr
                c = j + dc
                if(
                    r in range(m) and
                    c in range(n) and
                    heights[r][c] >= heights[i][j] and
                    (r, c) not in visited
                ):
                    dfs(r, c, visited)

        for k in range(m):
            dfs(k, 0, pac) # pacific
            dfs(k, n - 1, atl) # atlantic

        for k in range(n):
            dfs(0, k, pac) # pacific
            dfs(m - 1, k, atl) # atlantic

        return list(pac.intersection(atl))
```

## Notes

We are doing a graph search, starting from the edges of the matrix, and building the solution.
