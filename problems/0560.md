# [Problem 560: Subarray Sum Equals K](https://leetcode.com/problems/subarray-sum-equals-k/)

## Solution

```py
# Time complexity: O(n)
# Space complexity: O(n)
class Solution:
    def subarraySum(self, nums: List[int], k: int) -> int:
        ans = 0
        curr_sum = 0
        m = {0: 1}

        for num in nums:
            curr_sum += num
            diff = curr_sum - k
            ans += m.get(diff, 0)
            m[curr_sum] = m.get(curr_sum, 0) + 1

        return ans


# More Verbose Solution
# Time complexity: O(n)
# Space complexity: O(n)
class Solution:
    def subarraySum(self, nums: List[int], k: int) -> int:
        n = len(nums)
        prefix = [0] * (n + 1)

        for i in range(1, n + 1):
            prefix[i] = prefix[i - 1] + nums[i - 1]

        m = {}

        ans = 0

        for p in prefix:
            if p - k in m:
                ans += m[p - k]

            m[p] = m.get(p, 0) + 1

        return ans
```

## Notes

Brute force: O(n^2) time complexity, O(1) space complexity.
Efficient solution: O(n) time complexity, O(n) space complexity.

In the efficient solution, we keep track of prefix_sum and count. For every iteration, we check how many times the difference between the current prefix_sum and k has occurred before. We add that count to the answer. We also update the count of the current prefix_sum in the dictionary.

It is VERY similar to 2sum problem.
