# [Problem 1466: Reorder Routes to Make All Paths Lead to the City Zero](https://leetcode.com/problems/reorder-routes-to-make-all-paths-lead-to-the-city-zero/)

## Solution

```py
# Time complexity: O(n)
# Space complexity: O(n)
class Solution:
    def minReorder(self, n: int, connections: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        children = defaultdict(list)
        parents = defaultdict(list)

        for n1, n2 in connections:
            children[n1].append(n2)
            parents[n2].append(n1)

        visited = set()


        def helper(node):
            visited.add(node)

            total = 0

            # look at children and add 1 as we need to flip it
            for c in children[node]:
                if c in visited: continue
                total += 1 + helper(c)

            # since it is a parent, no need to flip it, but we might need to flip some children
            for p in parents[node]:
                if p in visited: continue
                total += helper(p)


            return total


        return helper(0)
```

## Notes

We perform a DFS. It is a graph problem where we start at node 0.
