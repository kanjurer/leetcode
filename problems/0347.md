# [Problem 347: Top K Frequent Elements](https://leetcode.com/problems/top-k-frequent-elements/)

## Solution

```py
# Heap Sort
# Time Complexity: O(n + klogn)
# Space Complexity: O(k)
class Solution:
    def topKFrequent(self, nums: List[int], k: int) -> List[int]:
        count = {}

        for num in nums:
            count[num] = count.get(num, 0) + 1

        heap = []

        for num, count in count.items():
            heapq.heappush(heap, (count,num))
            if len(heap) > k:
                heapq.heappop(heap)

        ans = []
        for count, num in heap:
            ans.append(num)

        return ans

# Bucket Sort
# Time Complexity: O(n)
# Space Complexity: O(n)
class Solution:
    def topKFrequent(self, nums: List[int], k: int) -> List[int]:
        n = len(nums)

        freq = [[] for _ in range(n + 1)]
        count = {}

        for num in nums:
            count[num] = count.get(num, 0) + 1

        for num, f in count.items():
            freq[f].append(num)

        ans = []

        for i in range(n, -1, -1):
            for num in freq[i]:
                if len(ans) == k:
                    return ans
                ans.append(num)

        return ans
```

## Notes

There are two solutions:

1. Heap Sort

First step: Make a dictionary to store the frequency of each number.
Second step: Store (count, num) pairs in heap. Maintain the heap size to `k`.
Third step: Return the nums from the heap.

2. Bucket Sort

First step: Make a dictionary to store the frequency of each number.
Second step: Store the numbers in buckets based on their frequency.
Third step: Return the numbers from the buckets from the highest frequency to the lowest frequency.

## Questions to interviewer
