# [Problem 1984: Minimum Difference Between Highest and Lowest of K Scores](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-difference-between-highest-and-lowest-of-k-scores/)

## Solution

```py
# Time complexity: O(nlogn)
# Space complexity: O(1)
class Solution:
    def minimumDifference(self, nums: List[int], k: int) -> int:
        n = len(nums)

        nums.sort() # sort the numbers

        ans = nums[n - 1] - nums[0]

        for i in range(0, n - k + 1):
            ans = min(ans, nums[i + k - 1] - nums[i]) # maintain a window and keep track of "range"

        return ans # return the minimum range
```

## Notes

Best way is to sort the array and then find a contiguous subarray of size k with minimum range.
Use a sliding window.

## Questions to interviewer

1. Can I use the sort function?
