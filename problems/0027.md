# [Problem 27: Remove Element](https://leetcode.com/problems/remove-element/)

## Solution

```py
# Time complexity: O(n)
# Space complexity: O(1)
class Solution:
    def removeElement(self, nums: List[int], val: int) -> int:
        n = len(nums)
        l = 0
        r = 0
        c = 0

        while r < n:
            if nums[r] != val:
                nums[r], nums[l] = nums[l], nums[r]
                l += 1
            r += 1

        return l
```

## Notes

This problem is very similar to [Problem 283: Move Zeroes](https://leetcode.com/problems/move-zeroes/). The only difference is that we are moving a specific value to the end of the array.

## Questions to interviewer

1. Can I assume that the input array is mutable?
