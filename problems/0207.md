# [Problem 207: Course Schedule](https://leetcode.com/problems/course-schedule/)

## Solution

```py
# Time complexity: O(E + V)
# Space complexity: O(v)
class Solution:
    def canFinish(self, numCourses: int, prerequisites: List[List[int]]) -> bool:
        adj = defaultdict(list)

        for c, p in prerequisites:
            adj[c].append(p)

        visited = set()

        def dfs(c):
            if c in visited:
                return False

            if not adj[c]:
                return True

            visited.add(c)
            for p in adj[c]:
                if not dfs(p):
                    return False
                adj[c].remove(p)
            visited.remove(c)

            return True

        # run dfs on all courses
        for i in range(numCourses):
            if not dfs(i):
                return False

        return True
```

## Notes

Here, there are couple things we need to take care of:

1. We need to run `dfs()` on every node in the graph. The reason is because the graph can be disconnected, and we need to make sure that we visit every node.
2. Next step is to form an `adj` list. It is a common approach in most graph problems.
3. We need to keep track of the visited nodes. We can do this by using a `visited` list. We do this because we do not want to visit the same node again. This is important to detect cycles in graph.
