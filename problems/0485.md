## Solution

```py
# Time complexity: O()
# Space complexity: O()
class Solution:
    def findMaxConsecutiveOnes(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        count = 0
        ans = 0

        for num in nums:
            if num == 1:
                count += 1
                ans = max(ans, count)
            else:
                count = 0

        return ans
```
