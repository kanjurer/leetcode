# [Problem 3: Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters](https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-substring-without-repeating-characters/)

## Solution

```py
# Time complexity: O(n)
# Space complexity: O(n)
class Solution:
    def lengthOfLongestSubstring(self, s: str) -> int:
        m = set()

        l = 0
        ans = 0

        for r in range(len(s)):
            while s[r] in m:
                m.remove(s[l])
                l += 1
            ans = max(ans, r - l + 1)
            m.add(s[r])

        return ans
```

## Notes

Dynamic Sliding Window approach: We maintain a set to keep track of characters in the current and move the left pointer if we find any repeating character.

## Questions to interviewer

1. Can I assume that the string is always non-empty?
