# [Problem 74: Search a 2D Matrix](https://leetcode.com/problems/search-a-2d-matrix/)

## Solution

```py
# Time complexity: O(log(m*n))
# Space complexity: O(1)
class Solution:
    def searchMatrix(self, matrix: List[List[int]], target: int) -> bool:
        m = len(matrix)
        n = len(matrix[0])

        l = 0
        r = m * n - 1

        while l <= r:
            i = (l + r) // 2

            row = i // n
            col = i % n

            if matrix[row][col] < target:
                l = i + 1
            elif matrix[row][col] > target:
                r = i - 1
            else:
                return True

        return False
```

## Notes

Binary search solution: Treat it as a simple 1D array and calculate the row and column indices.

```
row = i // n
col = i % n
```

## Questions to interviewer

1. Are the rows sorted as well?
2. I can code up a solution in O(m.log(n)) time complexity. But with the extra property, I can solve it in O(log(m\*n)) time complexity. Can I use the extra property?
