# [Problem 1791: Find Center of Star Graph](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-center-of-star-graph/)

## Solution

```py
# Time complexity: O(1)
# Space complexity: O(1)
class Solution:
    def findCenter(self, edges: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        first, second = edges[0], edges[1]

        return first[0] if first[0] in second else first[1]


# Time complexity: O(n)
# Space complexity: O(1)
class Solution:
    def findCenter(self, edges: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        m = len(edges)
        n = len(edges[0])

        ans = edges[0][0]
        count = 1

        for r in range(m):
            for c in range(n):
                if count == 0:
                    ans = edges[r][c]

                count += 1 if ans == edges[r][c] else -1

        return ans

# Time complexity: O(n)
# Space complexity: O(n)
class Solution:
    def findCenter(self, edges: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        degree = {}

        for edge in edges:
            degree[edge[0]] = degree.get(edge[0], 0) + 1
            degree[edge[1]] = degree.get(edge[1], 0) + 1

        for node, count in degree.items():
            if count == len(edges):
                return node

        return -1

```

## Notes

Normal way: count the degree of each node and return the node with degree n - 1 (degree is the number of edges connected to the node).

O(1) way: return the node that is common to all edges, which is simply the node common between first and second edge.

Moore's voting algorithm: Find the node that appears the most in 2d array.

## Questions to interviewer

1. Is the input of form n x 2?
