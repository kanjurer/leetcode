# [Problem 2285: Maximum Total Importance of Roads](https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-total-importance-of-roads/)

## Solution

```py
# Time complexity: O(n * log(n) + m) where m is number of edges and n is number of cities
# Space complexity: O(n)
class Solution:
    def maximumImportance(self, n: int, roads: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        degrees = [0] * n

        for road in roads:
            degrees[road[0]] += 1
            degrees[road[1]] += 1

        degrees.sort()

        ans = 0
        val = 1
        for d in degrees:
            ans += d * val
            val += 1

        return ans
```

## Notes

The idea is that the max_importance should be assigned to city with the highest degree. Then, we can sort the degrees and assign the importance to each city.

Important case to consider if two cities have the same degree, in which case it does not matter which city we assign the importance to, because the total importance will be the same.

Proof:

Let's say two cities have the same degree `d` and we want to assignmen importances `a` and `b` to them. The total importance will be `d * a + d * b = d * b + d * a` so it does not matter which city we assign the importance to.
