# [Problem 153: Find Minimum in Rotated Sorted Array](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-minimum-in-rotated-sorted-array/)

## Solution

```py
# Time complexity: O(log(n))
# Space complexity: O(1)
class Solution:
    def findMin(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        n = len(nums)

        ans = nums[0]

        l = 0
        r = n - 1

        while l <= r:
            i = l + (r - l) // 2
            ans = min(ans, nums[i])

            if nums[i] > nums[r]: # look right
                l = i + 1
            else: # look left
                r = i - 1

        return ans

```

## Notes

In this question, we do NOT know how many times the array has been rotated. To find it, we can either do it in O(n) time, or we can use binary search to find the inflection point in O(log(n)) time.

The question states that the sorted array has UNIQUE elements!

Examples:

```
[4, 5, 6, 0, 1, 2, 3]

[5, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4]

[5, 0, 1, 5, 5, 5, 5]

[5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 5]

[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]

[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 0]
```

## Questions to interviewer

1. What if the array is empty?
