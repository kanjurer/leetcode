# [Problem 633: Sum of Square Numbers](https://leetcode.com/problems/sum-of-square-numbers/)

## Solution

```py
# Time complexity: O(n^2)
# Space complexity: O(1)
class Solution:
    def countSubstrings(self, s: str) -> int:
        n = len(s)
        res = 0

        for i in range(n):
            # odd
            l, r = i, i
            while l >= 0 and r < n and s[l] == s[r]:
                res += 1
                l -= 1
                r += 1

            # even
            l, r = i, i + 1
            while l >= 0 and r < n and s[l] == s[r]:
                res += 1
                l -= 1
                r += 1

        return res
```

## Notes

Idea: We calculate the number of palindromic substrings by expanding around the center.

We calculate odd and even length palindromes separately.
