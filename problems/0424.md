# [Problem 424: Longest Repeating Character Replacement](https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-repeating-character-replacement/)

## Solution

```py
# Time complexity: O(n)
# Space complexity: O(n)
class Solution:
    def characterReplacement(self, s: str, k: int) -> int:
        m = {}

        l = 0
        max_freq = 0
        ans = 0

        for r in range(len(s)):
            m[s[r]] = m.get(s[r], 0) + 1
            max_freq = max(max_freq, m[s[r]]) # update max_freq on every iteration
            if r - l + 1 - max_freq > k:
                m[s[l]] -= 1
                l += 1 # no need to update max_freq here (why?)
            ans = max(ans, r - l + 1)

        return ans



# Time complexity: O(26*n) = O(n)
# Space complexity: O(n)
class Solution:
    def characterReplacement(self, s: str, k: int) -> int:
        m = {}

        l = 0
        ans = 0

        for r in range(len(s)):
            m[s[r]] = m.get(s[r], 0) + 1
            while r - l + 1 - max(m.values()) > k: # the max(m.values()) can be optimized by maintaining max_freq
                m[s[l]] -= 1
                l += 1
            ans = max(ans, r - l + 1)

        return ans
```

## Notes

Inspired by # [Problem 3: Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters](https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-substring-without-repeating-characters/).

Same technique as this problem, but we need to keep track of the maximum frequency of any character in the current window.
Then, as long as `(win_size - max_freq = needed_replacements ) <= allowed_replacements`, we simply keep expanding the window.

## Questions to interviewer

1. What is the character set of the input string?
