# [Problem 252: Meeting Rooms](https://leetcode.com/problems/meeting-rooms/)

## Solution

```py
# Time complexity: O(nlogn)
# Space complexity: O(1)
class Solution:
    def canAttendMeetings(self, intervals: List[Interval]) -> bool:
        intervals.sort(key=lambda i: i.start)

        for i in range(1, len(intervals)):
            i1 = intervals[i - 1]
            i2 = intervals[i]

            if i1.end > i2.start:
                return False
        return True
```

## Notes

We sort them and compare if the end time of the previous meeting is greater than the start time of the next meeting.
We also use the fact that start_i is always less than end_i for each i, so we do not need to worry about that.

## Questions to interviewer

1. Is start_i always less than end_i?
