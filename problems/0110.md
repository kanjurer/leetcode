# [Problem 110: Balanced Binary Tree](https://leetcode.com/problems/balanced-binary-tree/)

## Solution

```py
# Time complexity: O(n)
# Space complexity: O(n)
class Solution:
    def isBalanced(self, root: Optional[TreeNode]) -> bool:
        def dfs(root: Optional[TreeNode])->tuple[bool, int]:
            if not root:
                return True, 0

            l_bal, l_height = dfs(root.left)
            r_bal, r_height = dfs(root.right)

            return l_bal and r_bal and abs(l_height - r_height) <= 1, 1 + max(l_height, r_height)

        is_bal, height = dfs(root)

        return is_bal

```

## Notes

**IMPORTANT COMMON TRICK:** Make a `dfs()` function for recursion/

- At each point, we want to make sure that the left and right subtree are balanced and the difference in their height is less than or equal to 1.
- We return the height of the current node as well.
