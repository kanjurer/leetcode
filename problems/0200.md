## Solution

```py
# Time complexity: O(m*n)
# Space complexity: O(m*n)
class Solution:
    def numIslands(self, grid: List[List[str]]) -> int:
        if not grid:
            return 0

        m = len(grid)
        n = len(grid[0])
        ans = 0
        visited = set()

        def bfs(i: int, j: int):
            q = deque([(i, j)])
            visited.add((i, j))

            while q:
                nr, nc = q.popleft()
                directions = [(1, 0), (-1, 0), (0, 1), (0, -1)]

                for dr, dc in directions:
                    r = nr + dr
                    c = nc + dc
                    if (
                        r in range(m)
                        and c in range(n)
                        and grid[r][c] == "1"
                        and (r, c) not in visited
                    ):
                        visited.add((r, c))
                        q.append((r, c))

        for i in range(m):
            for j in range(n):
                if grid[i][j] == "1" and (i, j) not in visited:
                    bfs(i, j)
                    ans += 1

        return ans
```

## Notes

So we are performing a graph search and for each `(i, j)` in grid, we are expanding the island by visiting all the connected `1`s. Once we do that, we mark the nodes as `visited` so we don't end up counting them again.

We can use BFS or DFS to solve this problem. Here we are using BFS.

## Questions to interviewer

1. Should I use BFS or DFS?
