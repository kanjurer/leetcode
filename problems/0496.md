# [Problem 496: Next Greater Element I](https://leetcode.com/problems/next-greater-element-i/)

## Solution

```py
# Time complexity: O(n)
# Space complexity: O(n)
class Solution:
    def nextGreaterElement(self, nums1: List[int], nums2: List[int]) -> List[int]:
        s = []
        m = {}

        # monotonic stack
        for num in nums2:
            while s and num > s[-1]:
                m[s.pop()] = num

            s.append(num)

        while s:
            m[s.pop()] = -1


        for i in range(len(nums1)):
            nums1[i] = m[nums1[i]]

        return nums1
```

## Notes

For this, we use a monotonic stack. We iterate through `nums` from left to right, and keep adding elements to the stack. As soon as we encounter an element that is greater than the top of the stack, we pop all the elements from the stack, and set their "next greater element" current number. We use hashmap to store these.

At the end, all the elements that are left in the stack have no next greater element.

Brute force approach would be to iterate through `nums2` for each element in `nums1`, and find the next greater element. This would be `O(n^2)`.
