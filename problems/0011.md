# [Problem 11: Container With Most Water](https://leetcode.com/problems/container-with-most-water/)

## Solution

```py
# Time complexity: O(n)
# Space complexity: O(1)
class Solution:
    def maxArea(self, height: List[int]) -> int:
        n = len(height)
        l = 0
        r = n - 1
        max_area = 0

        while l < r:
            max_area = max(max_area, min(height[l], height[r]) * (r - l))

            if height[l] < height[r]:
                l += 1
            else:
                r -= 1

        return max_area

# Time complexity: O(n^2)
# Space complexity: O(1)
class Solution:
    def maxArea(self, height: List[int]) -> int:
        n = len(height)

        area = -1

        for i in range(n):
            for j in range(i + 1, n):
                area = max(area, (j - i) * min(height[i], height[j]))

        return area
```

## Notes

A good explanation for why we move pointer with the lower height is because we already have the max area with that height since it is the lower pointer that means that every other distance that is closer will always be a smaller distance with the same or less height which means smaller area.

Therefore, we do not need to look at every other combination with that pointer.

## Questions to interviewer

1. Can I assume that the height of the container is always positive?
