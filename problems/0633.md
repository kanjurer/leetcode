# [Problem 633: Sum of Square Numbers](https://leetcode.com/problems/sum-of-square-numbers/)

## Solution

```py
# Two pointers
# Time complexity: O(sqrt(c))
# Space complexity: O(1)
class Solution:
    def judgeSquareSum(self, c: int) -> bool:
        l, r = 0, floor(sqrt(c))

        while l <= r:
            if l * l + r * r < c:
                l += 1
            elif l * l + r * r > c:
                r -= 1
            else:
                return True

        return False



# Time complexity: O(c)
# Space complexity: O(1)
class Solution:
    def judgeSquareSum(self, c: int) -> bool:
        for i in range(floor(sqrt(c)) + 1):
            for j in range(floor(sqrt(c)) + 1):
                if i ** 2 + j ** 2 == c:
                    return True

        return False

```

## Notes

Best solution: Motivated by [Problem 167: Two Sum II - Input array is sorted](https://leetcode.com/problems/two-sum-ii-input-array-is-sorted/).

Brute force solution: Check all possible pairs of numbers that sum to `c`.
