# [Problem 253: Meeting Rooms II](https://leetcode.com/problems/meeting-rooms-ii/)

## Solution

```py
# Chronological Ordering
# Time complexity: O(nlogn)
# Space complexity: O(n)
class Solution:
    def minMeetingRooms(self, intervals: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        times = []
        for start, end in intervals:
            times.append((start, 1))
            times.append((end, -1))

        times.sort()

        count = 0
        ans = 0
        for t in times:
            count += t[1]
            ans = max(ans, count)

        return ans

# Heaps

class Solution:
    def minMeetingRooms(self, intervals: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        intervals.sort()

        n = len(intervals)

        heap = []

        for i in intervals:
            if not heap:
                heappush(heap, i[1])
            else:
                if heap[0] <= i[0]:
                    heappop(heap)
                    heappush(heap, i[1])
                else:
                    heappush(heap, i[1])

        return len(heap)
```

## Notes

Approach 1: Chronological Ordering

We can use a list to store the start and end times of the meetings. We can sort them and iterate through them. We can keep track of the number of meetings that are currently happening. We can keep track of the maximum number of meetings that are happening at the same time.

Approach 2: Heaps

We can sort the meetings based on the start time. We can use a min heap to store the end times of the meetings. We can iterate through the meetings and check if the start time of the current meeting is greater than the end time of the meeting at the top of the heap. If it is, we can pop the meeting at the top of the heap and push the end time of the current meeting. If it is not, we can push the end time of the current meeting. The size of the heap at the end will be the minimum number of meeting rooms required.
