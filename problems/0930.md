## Solution

```py
# Time complexity: O(n)
# Space complexity: O(1)
class Solution:
    def numSubarraysWithSum(self, nums: List[int], goal: int) -> int:
        n = len(nums)

        def helper(x):
            """
            Returns total subarrays with sum less than or equal to x
            """
            if x < 0: return 0

            res = 0
            l = 0
            curr = 0
            for r in range(n):
                curr += nums[r]
                while curr > x:
                    curr -= nums[l]
                    l += 1
                res += r - l + 1

            return res

        return helper(goal) - helper(goal - 1)


# Time complexity: O(n)
# Space complexity: O(n)
class Solution:
    def numSubarraysWithSum(self, nums: List[int], goal: int) -> int:
        ans = 0
        curr_sum = 0
        m = {0: 1}

        for num in nums:
            curr_sum += num
            diff = curr_sum - goal
            ans += m.get(diff, 0)
            m[curr_sum] = m.get(curr_sum, 0) + 1

        return ans


# Time complexity: O(n^2)
# Space complexity: O(1)
class Solution:
    def numSubarraysWithSum(self, nums: List[int], goal: int) -> int:
        n = len(nums)
        ans = 0

        for i in range(n):
            curr_sum = 0
            for j in range(i, n):
                curr_sum += nums[j]
                if curr_sum == goal:
                    ans += 1
                elif curr_sum > goal:
                    break

        return ans
```

## Notes

_There are three solutions:_

### Brute force

Here, we iterate over all subarrays and check if the sum of the subarray is equal to the goal

### Linear time and space

Checkout [Problem 560: Subarray Sum Equals K](https://leetcode.com/problems/subarray-sum-equals-k/).

### Linear time and constant space

This is very tricky solution. This solution only works as the numbers are positive, so we can use sliding window and move the left pointer to the right with `curr_sum > x` condition. Had `x` been negative, this would not have worked.

The point is to count all the subarrays with `sum <= goal`. Then, `num(sum == goal) = num(sum <= goal) - num(sum <= goal - 1)`. To count ALL the subarrays, we need to add length of the subarray instead of `1`.
