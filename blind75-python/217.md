# Problem 217: Contains Duplicate

## Solution

```py
class Solution:
    def containsDuplicate(self, nums: List[int]) -> bool:
        return len(nums) != len(set(nums))
```

## Notes

A set is a data structure that only contains unique elements. We can use a set to keep track of the elements we've seen so far. If we encounter an element that we've already seen, we know that the array contains a duplicate.

## Questions to interviewer

1. Am I allowed to use additional space?
2. Do you want O(n) time?
